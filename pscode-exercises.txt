Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

const num1 = 5;
const num2 = 10;
const sum = num1 + num2;
console.log("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum);


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

const num = 7;
if (num % 2 === 0) {
  console.log("The number is even.");
} else {
  console.log("The number is odd.");
}

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


const numbers = [];

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  const num = prompt(`Enter number ${i}:`);
  numbers.push(Number(num));
}

const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
const average = sum / numbers.length;
const smallest = Math.min(...numbers);
const largest = Math.max(...numbers);
console.log("The average of the five numbers is:", average);
console.log("The smallest number is:", smallest);
console.log("The largest number is:", largest);
